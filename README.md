# Chess Game for Android

A small project I've started working on after watching this [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-developer/).

## Description

It's an offline chess game in which you can choose between some game modes 
(classic, rapid, bullet), it's supposed to be played by 2 people on the same phone. 
You can also view your games history and go through each move one by one

## Technologies Used

- Kotlin with Jetpack Compose
- ROOM Database
- Retrofit
- Android SDK
- XML
- Gradle

## What's Next?

I'm planning to create an online version using a server built on SpringBoot & MongoDB, in which you can create your own account 
and play against other players who're looking for a match (like lichess or chess.com). I'm not going to implement the ranking system (probably),
but the number of wins and losses associated with the 2 users who're playing against each other will be displayed next to their usernames during the match
